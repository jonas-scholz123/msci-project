==========, greetings
Welcome back .
Here we go again .
Great to see you and congratulations .
Thank you .
==========, child, birth
You will never forget what is going on in the world when you think about when your child is born .
You will know for the rest of this child ’ s life , you were born during a weird time .
That ’ s for sure .
That is for sure .
Probably the weirdest that I can remember .
Yeah .
Yeah , and he was born on May the fourth .
That ’ s hilarious , too .
Yeah .
May the fourth be with him .
Yes , exactly .
It has to be .
Hopefully .
I sure hope so .
Perfect .
Yes .
I mean that was the perfect day for you .
==========, name
How do you say the name ?
Is it placeholder ?
First of all , my partner is the one that actually mostly came up with the name .
Congratulations to her .
Yeah , yeah .
She ’ s great at names .
I mean it ’ s just X , the letter X , and then the ae is like pronounced ash .
Yeah , and then eight , 12 is my contribution .
Oh , why are eight , 12 ?
==========, airplane, sr71, archangel_12
Archangel 12 , the precursor to the SR71 .
Coolest plane ever .
True .
I agree with you .
I don ’ t know , I ’ m not familiar with it .
I know what the SR71 is .
Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Yeah , I know what that is .
The SR71 came from a CIA program called Archangel .
It ’ s the Archangel project .
Oh wow , what a dope looking plane .
Yeah .
Oh , okay .
I got it .
Yeah .
Well , as a person who ’ s a very much into aerial travel as you are , that ’ s perfect .
It ’ s pretty great .
Yeah .
Pretty great .
==========, children
Does it feel strange to have a child while this craziness is going ?
Does it feel like you ’ ve had children before ?
Is this any weirder ?
Actually , I think it ’ s better being older and having a kid .
I appreciate it more .
Yeah , babies are awesome .
They are pretty awesome .
They ’ re awesome .
Yeah .
When I didn ’ t have any of my own , I would see other people ’ s kids and I didn ’ t not like them , but I wasn ’ t drawn to them .
But now when I see little people ’ s kids , I ’ m like , Oh , I think of them as like these little love packages .
Yeah , little love bugs .
Yeah .
It ’ s just you think of them differently when you see them come out and then grow and then eventually start talking to you , like your whole idea what a baby is , is very different .
Yeah .
Now , as you get older and get to appreciate it as a mature , fully formed adult , it must be really pretty wonderful .
Yeah .
Great .
Wonderful .
It ’ s great .
But babies are awesome .
Yeah , it ’ s great .
Yeah .
==========, ai, neural_net, brain
Also , I ’ ve spent a lot of time on AI and neural nets and so you can sort of see the brain develop , which is … An AI neural net is trying to simulate what a brain does , basically .
You can sort of see it learning very quickly .
You know , it ’ s just wow .
You ’ re talking about the neural net , you ’ re not talking about an actual baby .
I ’ m talking about an actual baby .
But both of them .
Yes , but the word neural net comes from the brain .
It ’ s like a net of neurons .
Humans are the original gangster of the neural net .
That ’ s a great way to put it .
Yeah .
When you ’ re programming artificial intelligence where you ’ re working with artificial intelligence art , are they specifically trying to mimic the developmental process of a human brain ?
In a lot of ways .
There ’ s some ways that are different .
An analogy that ’ s often used is like we don ’ t make a submarine swim like a fish , but we take the principles of hydrodynamics and apply them to the submarine .
I ’ ve always wondered as a lay person , do you try to achieve the same results as the human brain but through different methods ?
Or do you try to copy the way a human brain achieves results ?
I mean , the essential elements of an AI neural net are really very similar to a human brain neural net .
Yeah .
It ’ s having the multiple layers of neurons and you know , back propagation .
All these things are what your brain does .
You have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition and then it ’ ll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place .
It ’ s interesting .
Very interesting .
Yeah , I would imagine .
The thought of programming something that is eventually going to be smarter than us that one day it ’ s going to be like , why did you do it that way ?
When artificial intelligence becomes sentient , they ’ re like , Oh , you tried to mimic yourself .
This is so much better process .
Cut out all this nonsense .
Like I said , there are elements that are the same but just like an aircraft does not fly like a bird .
Right .
It doesn ’ t flap its wings , but the wings , the way the wings work and generate lift is the same as a bird .
==========, houses, possessions
Now you ’ re in the middle of this strange time where you ’ re selling your houses .
You say you don ’ t want any material possessions and I ’ ve been seeing all that and I ’ ve been really excited to talk to you about this .
Because it ’ s an interesting thing to come from a guy like yourself .
Like why are you doing that ?
I ’ m slightly sad about it , actually .
If you ’ re sad about it , why are you doing it ?
I think possessions kind of weigh you down and they ’ re kind of an attack vector .
They ’ ll say , “ Hey , billionaire , you ’ ve got all this stuff .
” Well , now I don ’ t have stuff now what are you going to do ?
Attack vector meaning like people targeted .
Yeah .
Interesting , yeah .
But you ’ re obviously going to , so you ’ re going to rent a place ?
Yeah .
Okay , and get rid of everything except clothes ?
Keep a couple of Teslas .
Kind of have to , to test product and stuff .
You know , there ’ s things that have sentimental value for sure are keeping those .
I mean , what ’ s the worst that could happen ?
I mean , you ’ re fine .
Yeah , you can always buy more stuff if you don ’ t like it .
I suppose so .
Yeah , I mean from the money that you sell all your stuff , you can buy new stuff .
==========, billionaire, wealth
Do you feel like people define you by the fact that you ’ re wealthy and that they define you in a pejorative way ?
For sure .
I mean not everyone , but for sure in recent years billionaire has become pejorative like that ’ s a bad thing .
Which I think doesn ’ t make a lot of sense in most cases .
==========, company, wealth, products, services
If you basically organized a company … How does this wealth arise ?
If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before and you have some ownership in that company then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital .
There ’ s a conflation of consumption and capital allocation .
Take Warren Buffet , for example , and to be totally frank I ’ m not his biggest fan , but you know , he does like have full allocation and he reads a lot of annual reports of companies and all the accounting and it ’ s pretty boring really .
He ’ s trying to figure out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital ?
I mean it ’ s kind of a boring job if you ask me .
It ’ s still a thing that ’ s important to figure out .
Like , which is a company deserving of more or less capital .
Should that company grow or expand ?
Is it making products and services that are better than others or worse ?
If a company is making compelling products and services , it should get more capital and if it ’ s not , it should get less or go out of business .
Well , there ’ s a big difference , too , between someone who ’ s making an incredible amount of money designing and engineering fantastic products versus someone who ’ s making an incredible amount of money by investing in companies or moving money around in the stock market or doing things along those lines .
It ’ s a different thing and to put them all in the same category seems , it ’ s very simple .
As you pointed out , it ’ s an attack vector .
Yeah , for sure .
==========, united_states, careers
I think it ’ s really , I do think there , in the United States especially , there ’ s an over allocation of talent in finance and law .
Basically , too many smart people go into finance and law .
This is both a compliment and a criticism .
We should have , I think , fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Well that would certainly be better for all involved if they made better stuff .
Yeah , yeah , absolutely .
Manufacturing used to be highly valued in the United States and these days it ’ s not .
It ’ s often looked down upon , which I think is wrong .
Yeah .
Well , I think that people are kind of learning that particularly because of this whole pandemic and this relationship that we have with China , that there ’ s a lot of value in making things and to making things here .
Yes .
Somebody ’ s got to do the real work .
Yeah .
You know ?
Making a car , it ’ s an honest days living , that ’ s for sure .
Making anything , really , or providing a valuable service like providing good entertainment , good information , these are all valuable things to do .
Yeah , there should be more of it .
Yeah , I ’ ve been thinking about it for a while .
You know , part of it is like I have a bunch of houses , but I don ’ t spend a lot of time in most of them .
That doesn ’ t seem like a good use of assets .
Somebody could probably be enjoying those houses and get better use of them me .
==========, gene_wilder, house
Don ’ t you have Gene Wilder ’ s house ?
I do .
That ’ s amazing .
It ’ s awesome .
Wow .
Yes .
It ’ s exactly what you ’ d expect .
Did you request that the buyer not fuck it up ?
Yeah , that ’ s a requirement .
Oh , a requirement ?
That ’ s a good requirement .
Yeah .
In that case in that house .
Yeah , it ’ ll probably sell for less , but still I don ’ t care .
Oh , he ’ s a legend .
He ’ d want his soul , he ’ d want his essence in the building .
And it ’ s there .
Is it ?
It ’ s a real quirky house , yeah .
What makes you say that ?
What do you get out of it ?
I mean , all the cabinets are like handmade and they ’ re like odd shapes and there ’ s like doors to nowhere and strange corridors and tunnels and odd paintings on the wall .
Yeah .
Did you ever live in it ?
It ’ s very quirky .
I did live in it briefly , yeah .
But why do you buy houses ?
If you own all these houses , do you just get bored and go I think I ’ d like to have that ?
Well , I had one house and the Gene Wilder house is right across the road from me from my main house .
It was going to get sold and then torn down and turned into , you know , be a big construction zone for three years .
I was like , whoa , I think I ’ ll buy it and preserve the spirit of Gene Wilder and not have a giant construction zone .
Then I started having some privacy issues where people would just come to my house and start climbing over the walls and stuff .
Then I sort of bought some of the houses around my house and then I thought at one point , well you know , it ’ d be cool to build a house .
I acquired some properties at the top of Somera Road , which has got a great view , and I was like , okay , well there ’ s a bunch of sort of small older houses , they ’ re going to get torn down , anyway .
I was like , well , if I collect these little houses then I can build something , I don ’ t know , artistic like a dream house type of thing .
What ’ s a dream house for Elon Musk ?
Like some Tony stark type shit ?
Yeah , definitely .
Yeah .
You got to have the dome that opens up with the stealth helicopter and that kind of thing , you know ?
Yeah .
For sure .
Fuck yeah .
Definitely .
But then I was like , man , does it really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and I ’ d be real , you know , ghetto like OCD on the little details and the design , or should I be allocating that time to getting us to Mars ?
I should probably do the latter .
Like what ’ s more important ?
Mars or a house ?
I ’ m like Mars .
Okay .
Is that really how you think ?
==========, Mars
Like , I ’ d be better off planning on a trip to Mars or getting people to Mars ?
Yeah , yeah , definitely .
I mean , you can only do so many things .
Right .
Well , I don ’ t know how you do what you do anyway .
==========, Tesla, SpaceX, companies
I don ’ t understand how you can run The Boring Company , Tesla , SpaceX , all these different things you ’ re doing constantly .
I just , I don ’ t understand .
I mean , you explained last time you were here how you sort of allocate your time and how hectic it is and insane .
I still don ’ t , the productivity is baffling .
It just doesn ’ t make sense how you can get so much done .
5 % ?
That ’ s a good chunk .
It ’ s a good chunk .
Yeah , yeah .
We were talking about that last time and you were trying to figure out when it was actually going to go live , when it ’ s actually going to be available .
Are you testing on people right now ?
No , we ’ re not testing on people yet , but I think it won ’ t be too long .
==========, neural_link, brain, device
I think we may be able to implant a neural link in less than a year in a person I think .
When you do this , is there any tests that you have to do before you do something like this to see what percentage of people ’ s bodies are going to reject these things ?
Is there a potential for rejection ?
It ’ s a very low potential for rejection .
I mean , you can think of it like people put in heart monitors and things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation obviously like artificial hips and knees and that kind of thing .
The probability of , I mean , so it ’ s well known what will cause rejection and what will not .
It ’ s definitely harder when you ’ ve got something that is sort of reading and writing neurons that ’ s generating a current pulse and reading current pulses .
That ’ s a little harder than say a passive device , but it ’ s still very doable .
There are people who have primitive devices in their brains right now .
What kind of devices ?
Well , like deep brain stimulation , I think for Parkinson ’ s , has really changed people ’ s lives in a big way , which is kind of remarkable because it kind of like zaps your brain .
