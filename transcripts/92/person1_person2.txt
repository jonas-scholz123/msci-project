Speaker 4: (00:00:48)
Hey, how are you sir?

Speaker 4: (00:00:50)
How are y'all?

Speaker 4: (00:00:51)
How are you doing?

Speaker 4: (00:00:52)
Kenya?

Speaker 4: (00:00:52)
You asked me how I was doing.

Speaker 4: (00:00:54)
Yeah.

Speaker 4: (00:00:54)
Look at that politeness.

Speaker 3: (00:00:56)
Not that person.

Speaker 3: (00:00:59)
I'm doing good doing better feeling excited.

Speaker 3: (00:01:02)
I'm excited about this.

Speaker 1: (00:01:04)
Me too.

Speaker 4: (00:01:05)
Yeah, because I feel like this is fine like our baby.

Speaker 4: (00:01:07)
Hmm.

Speaker 1: (00:01:08)
I think Kenny and I have been trying to do a podcast for like a year outside of thousands of years and then and then pasta gay was like go ahead and gave us the green light because that's what it's all about.

Speaker 3: (00:01:20)
Right supporting our young people and letting them just like Flex their wings like the wings of they Spread their wings as a thing he'll but okay.

Speaker 3: (00:01:31)
Alright.

Speaker 1: (00:01:31)
So in this podcast we want to just have an open conversation.

Speaker 1: (00:01:36)
I think that one of the main things we were focusing on was the importance of having a three-way conversation with the you being not you mañana not you whoever is listening, but you God and we want to make sure that we are not just asking ourselves why God isn't like talking to us, but also making sure that we are seeking his voice each and every day.

Speaker 4: (00:01:57)
There's also the me part of the equation whose that me is me me me me gummy is yummy as me?

Speaker 3: (00:02:04)
No actually, it's me that he liked me better already.

Speaker 3: (00:02:08)
So the me is us is who me when Nia me Kenya me Paul wherever you are the Jill Hey Joe, how you doing?

Speaker 3: (00:02:22)
What's up?

Speaker 4: (00:02:23)
So me is who the perp wherever the person is.

Speaker 4: (00:02:27)
The individual who's living life going through life understanding life struggling with life.

Speaker 1: (00:02:34)
Hmm because overall goals its adult life in jail life is hard and then we have we who's we what so we well we this is the third part of our equation the third part of our conversation is what is the church the we is the church or we as a people, who are we as Seventh-Day Adventists?

Speaker 1: (00:02:54)
Who are we as the young people of this generation?

Speaker 1: (00:02:57)
And of the church and we want to make sure that we remember that we are a community we need to act like one and we need to move like one and we need to worry for each other like a community does worry for each other.

Speaker 1: (00:03:10)
So I think that that's an important piece of our conversation because as a community just because we're moving together in one sentiment does not mean that we're always going to see eye-to-eye that were not that were always going to agree because we come from different backgrounds and experience different things but the importance of having a conversation like this.

Speaker 1: (00:03:27)
This is that as a community we can come and we can be kind to each other and listen to each other stories and opinions true dat.

Speaker 1: (00:03:34)
Hmm.

Speaker 4: (00:03:34)
I like so Kenya.

Speaker 4: (00:03:37)
What does God I mean to you who is God was Jesus?

Speaker 1: (00:03:41)
Who is the Holy Spirit?

Speaker 1: (00:03:43)
Yeah.

Speaker 1: (00:03:43)
Are they?

Speaker 1: (00:03:44)
Who is them singular?

Speaker 1: (00:03:46)
Well, the Bible goes on and on about who they are.

Speaker 1: (00:03:49)
Right God is the beginning in the end.

Speaker 1: (00:03:52)
He is the Alpha and the Omega he is the all-mighty the all-knowing he is omnipotent omnipresent.

Speaker 3: (00:03:57)
Isn't all nations.

Speaker 3: (00:03:59)
Oh, yeah, they words all of the Omni.

Speaker 1: (00:04:02)
All of them.

Speaker 1: (00:04:04)
He is the creator he is life.

Speaker 1: (00:04:06)
Um, he is the the way right?

Speaker 3: (00:04:08)
I'll truth and the light.

Speaker 1: (00:04:10)
Yes, and he is I for like my life, I knew that and he is our creator and our heavenly father but going on to a more personal level.

Speaker 1: (00:04:21)
I'm a person with just a lot going on all the time a lot.

Speaker 1: (00:04:27)
Hang on outwardly a lot going on inwardly.

Speaker 1: (00:04:30)
There's just so much in my head so much in my heart and I've gone through so many things experience so many sometimes very chaotic moments in my life and through it.

Speaker 1: (00:04:40)
All.

Speaker 1: (00:04:40)
God has been my peace.

Speaker 1: (00:04:41)
God has been the one thing that just kind of like grabbed me by the shoulders and it's like all right.

Speaker 3: (00:04:46)
It's time to just chill.

Speaker 3: (00:04:47)
Yeah, no stop it.

Speaker 3: (00:04:49)
Calm down.

Speaker 1: (00:04:50)
Looks like we need a moment stand still and I mean in the Bible, there's Psalms 46:10.

Speaker 1: (00:04:57)
It says be still and know that I am God and I think that's one of my favorite affirmations where God is like just stand there and watch me work my wonders watch me be God watch me be able to work my wonders in your life and just show you of everything.

Speaker 1: (00:05:13)
You know, I'm capable of and I think that God for me has definitely been that still Small Voice that still whisper that we know from First Kings where it's like he didn't come in the fire.

Speaker 1: (00:05:23)
He didn't come in the strong wind.

Speaker 1: (00:05:24)
He came in the small whisper and to me he's constantly My small was burned I depend on him for all my piece all your calmness all of them.

Speaker 1: (00:05:33)
All the comments made need.

Speaker 4: (00:05:34)
So I'm just thinking God.

Speaker 3: (00:05:36)
This is our mom someone.

Speaker 1: (00:05:43)
Yeah, who is God to you and yours?

Speaker 1: (00:05:48)
Jesús Cristo El espíritu Santo karate.

Speaker 1: (00:05:52)
Letsa, yes, I didn't M1 is pretty good Multicultural multilingual dealing with everything multicolored all of the things.

Speaker 3: (00:06:07)
So I said God loves me.

Speaker 4: (00:06:12)
I know because I was the first that could come into my head about God and but pray for me my mom.

Speaker 4: (00:06:19)
So who is God to me God to me out of everything that we can think of when we think about God the word that comes to me is provider God is the person I look for when I am in need of things and in need of something and not Always necessarily as in God, I need money God.

Speaker 4: (00:06:43)
I need a new iPhone because my speaker is messed up.

Speaker 4: (00:06:47)
Oh God, I need furniture for my apartment because it has none but outside of those things.

Speaker 4: (00:06:55)
I think to look to God for when I'm in I'm lacking Joy.

Speaker 4: (00:07:01)
I need to join God fills me in that way and God when I am like whatever I'm lacking in God is always there and that brought me can you actually reminded me of Psalms 23 where it says the Lord is my shepherd.

Speaker 4: (00:07:15)
I shall not want and it's not the want of a child where it's like Mommy I need I want this and I want a new bar because Barbies are cute and I like pink but it's the the living without we actually look this up and in the Hebrew, it's not lacking not not in need of anything else your your fulfilled to the most.

Speaker 4: (00:07:39)
You could be and there's nothing else that you seek because God is there and God has filled everything that you could think of he provided the money, but he also provided the joy and the love that you're seeking and he fills all of that.

Speaker 1: (00:07:52)
So that's who God is to me that reminds me of my favorite biblical verse when you said like we're not lacking of like have enough of something is in 2nd Corinthians 9 12.

Speaker 3: (00:08:04)
I'm not mistaken Second Corinthians says his grace is sufficient for me is enough.

Speaker 1: (00:08:11)
Yeah, it's more everything.

Speaker 1: (00:08:12)
It's literally all-encompassing.

Speaker 1: (00:08:14)
I do not lack of anything and I think that it's a great point that you bring up that in Psalms 23.

Speaker 1: (00:08:19)
It's literally talking about like there is nothing else.

Speaker 4: (00:08:21)
I could ever want nothing you give you all your for your head.

Speaker 3: (00:08:25)
Green Pastures shiny so I don't want to thank you, but thanks God for the intention.

Speaker 3: (00:08:40)
Okay.

Speaker 1: (00:08:44)
So now there's a second part of our mission as we just covered the you part which is God and we wanted to have a moment to just be able to say, you know, who's got to me, but I think it's a Nice moment for you today at some point if you have an opportunity, I don't mean one.

Speaker 4: (00:08:59)
Yeah, I mean you listening you have an opportunity today to just do these things.

Speaker 1: (00:09:03)
Yeah, sit down and think about who is God to you.

Speaker 1: (00:09:06)
You can even pause this right now and just go ahead and stop it.

Speaker 1: (00:09:09)
Stop a moment and just be like who is God to me and meditate on all the Wonders and all the greatness of God, but there is a second part.

Speaker 1: (00:11:37)

Speaker 1: (00:11:52)
Oh, you ready?

Speaker 4: (00:11:53)

Lily on a memoir.

Speaker 1: (00:12:05)
what happened during the GC podcast the a look behind so the next part is we it was we who is our the we of this equation will them well, like we mentioned before you know, this we want to make sure we include the community which is our church the we part of this is our our church as a whole and we want to make sure that in the conversations that we have here, which we will have many and they will be very interesting we will Get to hear from some great people who we have invited as guests on the show.

Speaker 1: (00:12:42)
And I think that they will give us an understanding of how different we are as a people but how much we can learn from one another so we always have to remember that although it gets tough.

Speaker 1: (00:12:53)
Sometimes being you know, young person Adventists who ever we have a community that we can always reach out to and hopefully that Community will always be able to take you in with open arms, you know, remembering what is the church what as Adventists do we believe in what we believe in as a people of the Bible.

Speaker 1: (00:13:13)
I love the word of God.

Speaker 1: (00:13:14)
You know, what do we believe in?

Speaker 1: (00:13:16)
Who are we now what is our identity as the people who are waiting for his second coming.

Speaker 1: (00:13:22)
